## Description

(see: [his repository](https://github.com/spaarmann/PhysikBioProfilHomework))

Its purpose is to provide a service for schools that's capable of <b>reminding students of their homework</b>.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to our project, feel free, to do so via.<br />
* answering issues
* suggesting features and/or solutions
* or even forking the project and directly providing fixes and features.

At least for this repository (the server) you can freely do so and open pull requests whenever you think it might help.
But I highly recommend getting in contact with me before doing so, it may help you and me coordinating code updates.<br />
(As for the clients repo at Sebastians repos, please take a look at his readme to make sure what he would like you to do to help.)

## Cooperation ##

This project was originally started by Sebasian and I agreed on joining him when we both thought about commercializing the idea.<br />
As for now, he's responsible for the Android client and I'm responsible for the (cross platform) server.<br />
You can ask both of us if you need any information, but it may sometimes be quicker to take the above into consideration before getting in touch.

## Documentation

Documentation can currently be found in the [GitHub-Wiki](https://github.com/MarkL4YG/Homework_Server/wiki)  
*** Altough the [folder](https://github.com/MarkL4YG/Homework_Server/tree/bleeding/wiki) in the repo may be more up to date. ***
