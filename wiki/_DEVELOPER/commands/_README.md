# Native or not native ?  
A command is considered native, if the command is NOT PART OF A Plug-In or something similar  
thus officially supported.  
  
This does NOT mean its identifier has to include ```de.mlessmann.*```!  
In fact in is determined by whether or not the command class is included in the repository at "MarkL4YG/Homework_Server"  
  
If you are a developer please _do NOT include "native"_ anywhere in your ``HWCommandHandler`` classes name, path or identifier! Thanks!
